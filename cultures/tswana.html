                    <h3>Tswana people</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Tswana (Tswana: Batswana, singular Motswana) are a Bantu-speaking ethnic group who are
                         native to Southern Africa. The Tswana language is a principal member of the Sotho-Tswana
                         language group. Ethnic Tswana made up approximately 85% of the population of Botswana in
                         2011.
                         Batswana are the native people of south and eastern Botswana, and the Gauteng, North West,
                         Northern Cape and Free State provinces of South Africa, where the majority of Batswana are
                         located.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <h4>Early history of Batswana</h4>
                    <p>
                         The Batswana are descended mainly from Bantu-speaking tribes who migrated southward of Africa
                         around 600 AD, living in tribal enclaves as farmers and herders. Several Iron Age cultures
                         flourished from around 900 AD, including the Toutswemogala Hill Iron Age settlement. The
                         Toutswe were based in the eastern region of what is now Botswana, relying on Tswana cattle
                         breed held in kraals as their source of wealth. The arrival of the ancestors of the
                         Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the Vaal River to Botswana) has yet to be
                         dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising
                         complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes
                         that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads
                         made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and rhinoceros horn. Members
                         of the Bakwena, a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the
                         southern Kalahari by AD 1500, at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants
                         west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining
                         territories.
                         <br><br>
                         The Bangwaketse occupied areas to the west, while the Bangwato moved northeast
                         into formerly Bakalanga areas. Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana
                         migrated into the Okavango Delta, probably in the 1790s. The first written records relating to
                         modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become
                         the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast
                         herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their
                         neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were
                         fairly prosperous. One of these famous capitals was Kaditshwene which was the cultural capital
                         of the Bahurutshe people, one of the principal Tswana tribes and a centre of manufacturing and
                         trading, it had been founded in the late 1400s on the site of iron and copper ore deposits. The
                         remains of another major Tswana capital, Kweneng' ruins, are found in Suikerbosrand Nature
                         Reserve in South Africa. It was occupied from the 15th to the 19th century AD and was the
                         largest of several sizeable settlements inhabited by Tswana speakers prior to European arrival.
                         Several circular stone walled family compounds are spread out over an area 10 km long and 2 km
                         wide.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Batswana-Boer Wars</h4>
                    <p>
                         During the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the
                         Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to
                         control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which
                         in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely
                         complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the Batswapong and
                         other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners
                         from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions which
                         culminated with the pivotal showdown of the Battle of Dimawe fought with artillery and long
                         range rifles as well as musket fire. Although it was the Boer Commando led by the Boer
                         Commandant-General Pieter Scholtz and Paul Kruger, as an officer leading the Boer advance who
                         started the offensive, it was they who ended up on the retreat followed by Batswana's
                         retaliatory attacks into the then Transvaal's Marique district in which Boer settlements,
                         villages and farms were scotched. After about eight years of intermittent tensions and
                         hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on,
                         the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and
                         Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Battle of Khutiyabasadi</h4>
                    <p>
                         The Batawana's (Tswana tribe/clan) fight against invading Ndebele of 1884. When the amaNdebele
                         arrived at Toteng, they thus found the village abandoned. But, as they settled down to enjoy
                         their bloodless conquest, about seventy mounted Batawana under Kgosi Moremi's personal command
                         appeared, all armed with breech-loading rifles. In classic commando style the cavalry began to
                         harass the much larger enemy force with lethal hit and run volleys. Meanwhile, another group of
                         traditionally armed subjects of the Kgosi also made their presence known.
                         <br><br>
                         At this point the amaNdebele commander, Lotshe, took the bait dividing his army into two
                         groups. One party pursued Moremi's small force, while the other fruitlessly tried to catch up
                         to what they believed was the main body of Batawana.
                         As the invaders generally lacked guns, as well as horses, Moremi continued to harass his
                         pursuers, inflicting significant casualties while remaining unscathed.
                         <br><br>
                         The primary mission of Moremi's men was not, however, to inflict losses on the enemy so much as
                         to ensnare them into a well designed trap. His force thus gradually retreated northward towards
                         Khutiyabasadi, drawing the amaNdebele to where the main body of defenders were already well
                         entrenched.
                         As they approached the swamp area south Khutiyabasadi, Lotshe struggled to reunite his men,
                         perhaps sensing that they were approaching a showdown. But, instead, Moremi's Batawana, now
                         joined by Qhunkunyane's Wayeyi drew the amaNdebele still deeper into the swamps.
                         <br><br>
                         In this area of poor visibility, due to the thick tall reeds, the Batawana and Wayeyi were able
                         to employ additional tricks to lure the invaders towards their ultimate doom. At one point a
                         calf and its mother were tied to separate trees to make Lotshe's men think that they were
                         finally catching up to their main prize, the elusive Batawana cattle. As they pressed forward
                         the amaNdebele were further unnerved by additional hit and run attacks and sniping by small
                         bands of Batawana marksmen. Certainly they could not have been comfortable in the unfamiliar
                         Okavango environment.
                         <br><br>
                         It was at Kuthiyabasadi that the defenders' trap was finally sprung. At the time, the place was
                         an island dominated by high reeds and surrounded to the west by deep water. In the reeds, three
                         well armed Batawana regiments, joined by local Wayeyi, waited patiently. There they had built a
                         small wooden platform, upon which several men could be seen from across the channel, as well
                         tunnels and entrenchments for concealment. The amaNdebele were drawn to the spot by the
                         appearance of Batawana cavalry who crossed the channel to the island in their sight. In
                         addition, cattle were placed on a small islet adjacent to Kuthiyabasadi, while a group of
                         soldiers now made themselves visible by standing up on the wooden platform. Also at the
                         location was a papyrus bridge that had been purposely weakened at crucial spots. Surveying the
                         scene, Lotshe ordered his men to charge across the bridge over what he presumably thought was
                         no more than a small stream. As planned, the bridge collapsed when full of amaNdebele, who were
                         thus unexpectedly thrown into a deep water channel. Few if any would have known how to swim.
                         <br><br>
                         Additional waves of amaNdebele found themselves pinned down by their charging compatriots along
                         the river bank, which was too deep for them to easily ford. With the enemy thus in disarray,
                         the signal was given for the main body of defenders to emerge from their tunnels and trenches.
                         A barrage of bullets cut through Lotshe's lines from three sides, quickly turning the battle
                         into a one-sided massacre. It is said that after the main firing had ceased, the Wayeyi used
                         their mekoro to further attack the survivors trapped in the river, hitting them on the head
                         with their oars. In this way, many more were drowned. By the time the fighting was over, the
                         blood is reported to have turned the water along the course of the river black. While the total
                         number of casualties at Khutiyabasadi cannot be precisely known, observers in Bulawayo at the
                         time confirm that over 2,500 men had left on Lotshe's expedition and less than 500 returned.
                         <br><br>
                         While the bulk of the amaNdebele losses are believed to have occurred in and around
                         Khutiyabasadi itself, survivors of the battle were also killed while being mercilessly pursued
                         by the Batawana cavalry. Moremi was clearly determined to send a strong message to Lobengula
                         that his regiments were no match. Still others died of exhaustion and hunger while trying to
                         make their way home across the dry plains south of Chobe; the somewhat more hospitable route
                         through Gammangwato having been blocked by Khama. While the battle at Khutiyabasadi was a great
                         victory for the Batawana and defeat for the amaNdebele, for the Wayeyi of the region the
                         outcome is said to have been a mixed blessing. While they had shared in the victory over the
                         hated Amandebele, one of its consequences was a tightening of Batawana authority in the area
                         over them, as Moremi settled for a period at nearby Nokaneng
                    </p>

                    <h4>First Matabele War</h4>
                    <p>
                         The First Matabele War was fought between 1893 and 1894 in modern-day Zimbabwe. The British
                         South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company's Police,
                         with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana
                         (Bechuana) allies who marched on Bulawayo from the south commandeered by Khama III, the most
                         influential of the Batswana chiefs, and a staunch ally of the British. The Salisbury and Fort
                         Victoria columns marched into Bulawayo on 4 November 1893. The Imperial column from
                         Bechuanaland was nowhere to be seen. They had set march on 18 October heading north for
                         Bulawayo and had a minor skirmish with the Matabele near Mphoengs on 2 November. They finally
                         reached Bulawayo on 15 November, a delay which probably saved the Chartered Company's then

                    <p>
                         The Bophuthatswana Territorial Authority was created in 1961, and in June 1972 Bophuthatswana
                         was declared a self-governing state. On 6 December 1977 this 'homeland' was granted
                         independence by the South African government. Bophuthatswana's capital city was Mmabatho and
                         99% of its population was Tswana speaking. In March 1994, Bophuthatswana was placed under the
                         control of two administrators, Tjaart van der Walt and Job Mokgoro. The small, widespread
                         pieces of land were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994. Bophuthatswana now forms
                         part of the North West, Free State, Northern Cape, and Gauteng provinces.

                    <h4>Botswana</h4>
                    <p>
                         The republic of Botswana (formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland) is named for the
                         Tswana people. The country's eight major tribes/clans speak Tswana, which is also called
                         Setswana. All have a traditional Paramount Chief, styled Kgosikgolo, who is entitled to a seat
                         in the Ntlo ya Dikgosi (an advisory body to the country's Parliament). The Tswana dynasties are
                         all related. A person who lives in Botswana is a Motswana and the plural is Batswana.[17][18]
                         The three main branches of the Tswana tribe formed during the 17th century. Three brothers,
                         Kwena, Ngwaketse and Ngwato, broke away from their father, Chief Malope, to establish their own
                         tribes in Molepolole, Kanye and Serowe, probably in response to drought and expanding
                         populations in search of pasture and arable land. <br><br>

                         The principal Tswana tribes/clans are the:

                    <h4>South Africa</h4>
                    <p>
                         The largest number of ethnic Tswana people is located in modern-day South Africa. They are one
                         of the largest ethnic groups in the country, and the Tswana language is one of eleven official
                         languages in South Africa. There were over 4 million Tswana speakers in the country in 2012,[2]
                         with North West Province having a majority of 2,200,000 Tswana speakers. From 1948 to 1994,
                         South African Tswana people were defined by the Apartheid regime to be citizens of
                         Bophuthatswana, one of ten bantustans set up for the purpose of defending the policy of denying
                         black Africans citizenship in South Africa.

                    <h3>Setwana food and cuisine</h3>
                    <p>
                         Pap is a staple food made from cornmeal which is often eaten alongside meat or vegetables, as
                         is done in much of Africa. Borotho is a bread made from various types of flour. The most
                         popular sorghum porridge is Ting. Bogobe jwa Logala/Sengana is a traditional Setswana dish
                         prepared from sorghum porridge mixed/cooked with milk. Seswaa is Botswana's national dish and
                         is often served at weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. Seswaa is a pounded or shredded
                         meat and often served with Bogobe (Porridge). Madila is a sour cultured milk prepared from cow
                         and goat milk over a period of time until fully matured for consumption. Traditionally madila
                         were prepared using Lekuka a leather sack or bag used in processing and storing madila. Madila
                         is also traditionally used as relish, eaten with pap. It can also be used in popular Tswana
                         breakfast meal, motogo, to give the soft porridge that sour and milky taste.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Culture and attire</h3>
                    <p>
                         Batswana wear a cotton fabric known in Setswana as Leteisi and Sotho as Shweshwe. This fabric
                         is often used for wedding celebrations and other traditional celebrations. In Setswana
                         tradition mothers wear mogagolwane, a checkered small blanket during traditional baby-showers,
                         and married women during traditional weddings are identified by it, as well as during various
                         initiation ceremonies. Even during funerals Batswana women don mogagolwane.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>
                         Tswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion;
                         it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as
                         Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the
                         Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of
                         drums), and phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes
                         in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the
                         strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them
                         together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is
                         only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been
                         celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string
                         which the Segaba instrument does not have. Other notable modern Tswana music is Tswana Rap
                         known as Motswako
                    </p>

                    <h3>Visual arts</h3>
                    <p>
                         Batswana are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local dyes. The
                         baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large,
                         open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller
                         plates for winnowing pounded grain. Potters made clay pots for storing water, traditional beer
                         and also for cooking and hardly for commercial use. Craft makers made wooden crafts and they
                         made traditional cooking utensils such as leso and lehetlho, traditional wooden chairs and
                         drums among others.

                    <h3>Tswana astronomy</h3>
                    <p>
                         Astronomy is an old age tradition in Africa. As with all other cultures, various ethnic groups
                         developed their own interpretations of the solar system. Using their natural instrument the
                         eye, Batswana have observed, commented on and named celestial objects of interest to them.
                         There are more telling and specific names that relate to unique stellar patterns and their
                         seasonal appearance e.g. Selemela, Naka, Thutlwa, and Dikolojwane. According to Tswana culture,
                         the stars of Orion's sword were "dintsa le Dikolobe", three dogs chasing three pigs of Orion's
                         belt. The Milky Way was viewed by the Tswana as Molalatladi, the place where lightning rests.
                         It was further believed that this place of rest also kept the sky from collapsing and showed
                         the movement of time. Some even claimed that it turned the sun to the east, in a way to
                         explaining the rising of the sun. It was also believed that it was a supernatural footpath
                         across the sky along which ancestors' spirits walked. The moon (Ngwedi) is said to represent a
                         woman; it brings forth light but not as scorching as the Sun (Letsatsi) and its light is
                         associated with happiness. Venus is called Mphatlalatsana (the brilliant and blinding one) by
                         Batswana & Kopadilalelo (seeker of evening meals). The southern African calendar was made up of
                         354 days, (12 √ó 29.5 day lunar month). This was 11 days shorter than the solar year, an issue
                         which could not be ignored. The solution was to add an additional month, when necessary, to
                         "catch up". Some years were 12 months long, others 13. After the arrival of Europeans and the
                         introduction of the Gregorian calendar, it was noted that the Batswana people had started
                         forgetting the name of the 13th month. In contrast to Europe, where the new year is in the
                         middle of winter, in southern Africa it logically started in September or October at the start
                         of the new growing season.
