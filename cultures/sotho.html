                    <h3>Sotho people</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Sotho people, also known as the Basuto or Basotho, are a Bantu nation
                         native to Southern Africa. They split into different ethnic groups over time, due to regional
                         conflicts
                         and colonialism, which resulted in the modern Basotho, who have inhabited the region of
                         Lesotho, South
                         Africa since around the fifth century CE.

                         The modern Basotho identity emerged from the accomplished diplomacy of Moshoeshoe I, who
                         unified the
                         disparate clans of Sotho‚ÄìTswana origin that had dispersed across southern Africa in the early
                         19th
                         century. Most Basotho today live in Lesotho or South Africa, as the area of the Orange Free
                         State was
                         originally part of Moshoeshoe's nation (now Lesotho).
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <h4>Early history</h4>
                    <p>
                         Bantu-speaking peoples had settled in what is now South Africa by about 500 CE.
                         Separation from the Tswana is assumed to have taken place by the 14th century. The first
                         historical references to the Basotho date to the 19th century. By that time, a series of
                         Basotho kingdoms covered the southern portion of the plateau (Free State Province and parts of
                         Gauteng). Basotho society was highly decentralized, and organized on the basis of kraals, or
                         extended clans, each of which was ruled by a chief. Chiefdoms were united into loose
                         confederations
                    </p>

                    <h4>19th century</h4>
                    <p>
                         In the 1820s, refugees from the Zulu expansion under Shaka came into contact with the
                         Basotho people residing on the highveld. In 1823, pressure caused one group of Basotho, the
                         Kololo, to migrate north. They moved past the Okavango Swamp and across the Zambezi into
                         Barotseland, which is now part of Zambia. In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.
                         <br><br>
                         At about the same time, the Boers began to encroach upon Basotho territory. After the Cape
                         Colony was ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, farmers who opted to
                         leave the former Dutch colony were called the voortrekkers ("pioneers") and moved inland where
                         they eventually established independent polities.
                         <br><br>
                         At the time of these developments, Moshoeshoe I gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the
                         southern highveld. Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he moulded the
                         disparate refugee groups escaping the Difaqane into a cohesive nation. His leadership
                         allowed his small nation to survive the obstacles that destroyed other indigenous South African
                         kingdoms during the 19th century, such as the Zulu Mfecane, the inward expansion of the
                         voortrekkers and the plans of the Colonial Office.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1822, Moshoeshoe established the capital at Butha-Buthe, an easily defensible mountain in
                         the northern Drakensberg mountain range, thus laying the foundations of the eventual Kingdom of
                         Lesotho. His capital was later moved to Thaba Bosiu.
                         <br><br>
                         To deal with the encroaching voortrekker groups, Moshoeshoe encouraged French missionary
                         activity in his kingdom. Missionaries sent by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society
                         provided the King with foreign affairs counsel and helped to facilitate the purchase of modern
                         weapons.
                         <br><br>
                         Aside from acting as state ministers, missionaries (primarily Casalis and Arbousset) played a
                         vital role in delineating Sesotho orthography and printing Sesotho language materials between
                         1837 and 1855. The first Sesotho translation of the Bible appeared in 1878.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1868, after losing the western lowlands to the Boers during the Free State‚ÄìBasotho Wars,
                         Moshoeshoe successfully appealed to Queen Victoria to proclaim Basutoland (modern Lesotho) a
                         protectorate of Britain. Accordingly, the British administration was established in Maseru, the
                         site of Lesotho's current capital. Local chieftains retained power over internal affairs,
                         while Britain was responsible for foreign affairs and the defense of the protectorate.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1869, the British sponsored a process to demarcate the borders of Basutoland. While many
                         clans had territory within Basutoland, large numbers of Sesotho speakers resided in areas
                         allocated to the Orange Free State, the sovereign voortrekker republic that bordered the
                         Basotho kingdom.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Cannibalism</h4>
                    <p>
                         The practice of cannibalism increased among the Basotho during the times of lifaqane (literally
                         "need for sustenance" or "we want") when there were many refugees fleeing wars
                         started by the Zulu King Shaka. According to missionary Ellenberger,[who?] the people who
                         practiced cannibalism were the Bakhatla of Tabane, specifically those who were ruled by the
                         Chief Rakotsoane at Sefikeng.
                         <br><br>
                         The district of Mangane, now known as Bloemfontein, was described as ‚Äòinfested with cannibals‚Äô
                         by the end of 1822. A cave at Mohale's Hoek had a brotherhood of 27 cannibals
                         who were under the leadership of Motlejoa. Other areas known to have cannibals included the
                         river banks of Cornelius Spruit, where there were several villages of cannibals.
                         <br><br>
                         According to the Basotho, cannibals are regarded as people having evil supernatural powers
                         comparable with Satan or spirits of the dead that oppose the good spirits and Basotho
                         ancestors. Their tradition states that the great Bakoena chief, Mohlomi, prophesied the coming
                         of the lifaqane and cannibalism on his death bed with the words, "After my death, a cloud of
                         red dust will come out of the east and consume our tribes. The father will eat his children. I
                         greet you all, and depart to where our fathers rest."
                         <br><br>
                         The Basotho cannibals believed that their human victims would appease the gods. Missionaries
                         who arrived in 1883 estimated that there were between 7,000 and 8,000
                         Basotho practicing cannibalism between the Orange River, the Drakensberg and the Vaal
                         river.
                         <br><br>
                         Moeshoeshoe and his people experienced an attack by cannibals as they moved from Butha Buthe to
                         Thaba Bosiu seeking safety from King Shaka's wars in 1824. During the attack, the cannibals
                         captured and ate Moshoeshoe's grandfather, Peete. Although cannibals were the cause of his
                         grandfather's death, Moeshoeshoe chose not to punish captured cannibals. Instead, he decided to
                         aid them in their rehabilitation into society by giving them food and cattle.
                         <br><br>
                         From 1822 to 1828, there were about 300,000 victims of cannibalism. The practice stopped
                         shortly after the arrival of Christian missionaries as cannibalism was not tolerated in the
                         Christian lifestyle. The Cannibal Trail just outside Clarens in the eastern Free State runs
                         between the Rooiberge and Witteberg mountains, where cannibals used to reside.
                    </p>

                    <h4></h4>
                    <p>
                         Britain's protection ensured that repeated attempts by the Orange Free State, and later the
                         Republic of South Africa, to absorb part or all of Basutoland were unsuccessful. In 1966,
                         Basutoland gained its independence from Britain, becoming the Kingdom of Lesotho.
                         <br><br>
                         Sesotho is widely spoken throughout the sub-continent due to internal migration. To enter the
                         cash economy, Basotho men often migrated to large cities in South Africa to find employment in
                         the mining industry. Migrant workers from the Free State and Lesotho thus helped to spread
                         Sesotho to the urban areas of South Africa. It is generally agreed that migrant work harmed the
                         family life of most Sesotho speakers because adults (primarily men) were required to leave
                         their families behind in impoverished communities while they were employed in distant
                         cities.
                         <br><br>
                         Attempts by the apartheid government to force Sesotho speakers to relocate to designated
                         homelands had little effect on their settlement patterns. Large numbers of workers continued to
                         leave the traditional areas of Black settlement. Women gravitated towards employment as
                         agricultural or domestic workers while men typically found employment in the mining sector.
                         <br></br>
                         In terms of religion, the central role that Christian missionaries played in helping Moshoeshoe
                         I secure his kingdom helped to ensure widespread Basotho conversion to Christianity. Today, the
                         bulk of Sesotho speakers practice a form of Christianity that blends elements of traditional
                         Christian dogma with local, pre-Western beliefs. Modimo ("God") is viewed as a supreme being
                         who cannot be approached by mortals. Ancestors are seen as intercessors between Modimo and the
                         living, and their favor must be cultivated through worship and reverence. Officially, the
                         majority of Lesotho's population is Catholic.
                         <br><br>
                         The Basotho's heartland is the Free State province in South Africa and neighboring Lesotho.
                         Both of these largely rural areas have widespread poverty and underdevelopment. Many
                         Sesotho speakers live in conditions of economic hardship, but people with access to land and
                         steady employment may enjoy a higher standard of living. Landowners often participate in
                         subsistence or small-scale commercial farming ventures. However, overgrazing and land
                         mismanagement are growing problems

                    <p>
                         The allure of urban areas has not diminished, and internal migration continues today for many
                         black people born in Lesotho and other Basotho heartlands. Generally, employment patterns
                         among the Basotho follow the same patterns as broader South African society. Historical factors
                         cause unemployment among the Basotho and other Black South Africans to remain high. <br><br>

                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    <p>
                         The language of the Basotho is referred to as Sesotho, less commonly known as Sesotho sa
                         borwa. Some texts may refer to Sesotho as "Southern Sotho" to differentiate it from
                         Northern Sotho, also called Sepedi. Sesotho is the first language of 1.5 million people in
                         Lesotho, or 85% of the population.
                         It is one of the two official languages in Lesotho, the other being English. Lesotho enjoys
                         one of Africa's highest literacy rates, with 59% of the adult population being literate,
                         chiefly in Sesotho.
                         <br><br>
                         Sesotho is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa. According to the South
                         African National Census of 2011, almost 4 million people speak Sesotho as a first language,
                         including 62% of Free State inhabitants. Approximately 13.1% of the residents of Gauteng
                         speak Sesotho as a first language. In the North West Province, 5% of the population speak
                         Sesotho as a first language, with a concentration of speakers in the Maboloka region. Three
                         percent of Mpumalanga's people speak Sesotho as a first language, with many speakers living in
                         the Standerton area. Two percent of the residents of the Eastern Cape speak Sesotho as a
                         first language, though they are located mostly in the northern part of the province.
                         <br><br>
                         Aside from Lesotho and South Africa, 60,000 people speak Silozi (a close relative of Sesotho)
                         in Zambia. Additionally, a few Sesotho speakers reside in Botswana, Eswatini and the
                         Caprivi Strip of Namibia. No official statistics on second language usage are available,
                         but one conservative estimate of the number of people who speak Sesotho as a second (or later)
                         language is 5 million.
                         <br><br>
                         Sesotho is used in a range of educational settings both as a subject of study and as a medium
                         of instruction. It is used in its spoken and written forms in all spheres of education,
                         from preschool to doctoral studies. However, the number of technical materials (e.g. in the
                         fields of commerce, information technology, law, science, and math) in the language is still
                         relatively small.
                         <br><br>
                         Sesotho has developed a sizable media presence since the end of apartheid. Lesedi FM is a
                         24-hour Sesotho radio station run by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC),
                         broadcasting solely in Sesotho. There are other regional radio stations throughout Lesotho and
                         the Free State. Half-hour Sesotho news bulletins are broadcast daily on the SABC
                         free-to-air channel SABC 2. Independent TV broadcaster eTV also features a daily half-hour
                         Sesotho bulletin. Both SABC and the eTV group produce a range of programs that feature some
                         Sesotho dialogue.
                         <br><br>
                         In Lesotho, the Lesotho National Broadcasting Service broadcasts to South Africa via satellite
                         pay-TV provider, DStv. Most newspapers in Lesotho are written in Sesotho or both Sesotho and
                         English. There are no
                         fully fledged South African newspapers in Sesotho except for regional newsletters in Qwaqwa,
                         Fouriesburg, Ficksburg and possibly other Free State towns.
                         <br><br>
                         Currently, the mainstream South African magazine Bona includes Sesotho content. Since the
                         codification of Sesotho orthography, literary works have been produced in Sesotho. Notable
                         Sesotho-language literature includes Thomas Mofolo's epic Chaka, which has been translated into
                         several languages including English and German.

                    <h3>Clothing</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Basotho have a unique traditional attire. This includes the mokorotlo, a conical hat with a
                         decorated knob at the top that is worn differently for men and women. The Basotho blanket is
                         often worn over the shoulders or the waist and protects the wearer against the cold. Although
                         many Sotho people wear westernized clothing, often traditional garments are worn over them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Basotho herders</h4>
                    <p>
                         Many Basotho who live in rural areas wear clothing that suits their lifestyles. For instance,
                         boys who herd cattle in the rural Free State and Lesotho wear the Basotho blanket and large
                         rain boots (gumboots) as protection from the wet mountain terrain. Herd boys also often wear
                         woolen balaclavas or caps year-round to protect their faces from cold temperatures and dusty
                         winds.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Basotho women</h3>
                    <p>
                         Basotho women usually wear skirts and long dresses in bright colors and patterns, as well as
                         the traditional blankets around the waist. On special occasions like wedding celebrations, they
                         wear the Seshoeshoe, a traditional Basotho dress. The local traditional dresses are made using
                         colored cloth and ribbon accents bordering each layer. Sotho women often purchase this material
                         and have it designed in a style similar to West and East African dresses.
                         <br><br>
                         Women often wrap a long print cloth or a small blanket around their waist, either as a skirt or
                         a second garment over it. This is commonly known as a wrap, and it can be used to carry infants
                         on their backs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Special clothing items</h3>
                    <p>
                         Special clothing is worn for special events like initiation rites and traditional healing
                         ceremonies. For a Lebollo la basadi, or a girl's initiation ceremony, girls wear a beaded waist
                         wrap called
                         a thethana that covers the waist, particularly the crotch area and part of the buttocks. They
                         also wear grey blankets and goatskin skirts. These garments are worn by young girls and women,
                         particularly virgins.
                         <br><br>
                         For a Lebollo la banna, or a boy's initiation ceremony, boys wear a loincloth called a tshea as
                         well as colorful blankets. These traditional outfits are often combined with more modern items
                         like sunglasses.
                         <br><br>
                         Traditional Sotho healers wear the bandolier which consists of strips and strings made of
                         leather, sinew or beads that form a cross on the chest. The bandolier often has pouches of
                         potions attached to it for specific rituals or physical/spiritual protection. It is believed
                         that the San people adopted this bandolier attire for healers during times when the Basotho and
                         the San traded and developed ties through trade, marriage and friendship. The San people's use
                         of the bandolier can be seen in their rock paintings that date to the 1700s.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sotho Calendar</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Sesotho language has traditional names for the months of the familiar Gregorian calendar.
                         The names reflect a deep connection that the Basotho people traditionally have with the natural
                         world and the importance of agriculture.
                         <br><br>
                         Although the month names are often not used by the general public (being considered part of
                         "deep Sesotho"), they are regularly used in news broadcasts and other media and are more common
                         than English imports. Additionally, the names of the seasons and the days of the week are
                         regularly used by all speakers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Months</h3>
                    <p>
                         The names of the months (likhoeli) indicate special natural and agricultural events which
                         traditionally happened during the period. Being cattle breeders who lived in the semi-arid
                         regions of southern Africa, a deep understanding of agriculture and the natural world was
                         essential for the survival of the Basotho people. The year begins roughly in the month of
                         August, when the seeds are planted in anticipation of the next month's explosion of life.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                         <li>Phato (August) ‚Äì from the verb -fata (dig) as the barren fields are ploughed and prepared
                              in anticipation of the next months explosion of life.</li>
                         <li>Loetse (September) ‚Äì the grass grows and the cows grow fat on it. They produce so much milk
                              that the expression lebese lo etse (the milk has spilled over) is used.</li>
                         <li>Mphalane (October) ‚Äì this is a shortening of the compound noun Mphalane-ya-leshoma meaning
                              "The flower shoots of the boophone disticha plant", and it said that this is the time when
                              the flower starts producing shoots.</li>
                         <li>Pulungoana (November) ‚Äì many wildebeest deliver their young in this month, and the name is
                              a diminutive of pudumo (wildebeest).</li>
                         <li>Ts'itoe (December) ‚Äì large numbers of a species of small grasshopper (tshitwe) are found at
                              this time. Since cattle start producing less milk in this period, it is said that the cows
                              are being milked by the tshitwe grasshoppers.</li>
                         <li>Pherekhong (January) ‚Äì the crops begin to grow large and bird-scarers set up camp in their
                              fields. They erect small structures and phera ka khong (set up the rafters using old
                              pieces of dried wood).</li>
                         <li>Hlakola (February) ‚Äì the sorghum plants release a white substance (modula) signaling the
                              emergence of the ears of corn. As the ears of corn emerge, it is said that the modula are
                              being wiped off, and this name is a shortening of Hlakola-modula ("Wipe the modula off).
                         </li>
                         <li>Hlakubele (March) ‚Äì the sorghum grains are visible and birds start eating them. The name is
                              a compound noun from tlhaku tsa mabele (grains of sorghum).</li>
                         <li>'Mesa (April) ‚Äì there are large numbers of a certain species of grasshopper known as
                              mohlwane. Herd boys make fires at night and eat roasted maize with mohlwane. This gave
                              rise to the proverb Mmesa mohlwane ha a panye (one needs to be diligent when doing a job,
                              lit. the mohlwane roaster does not blink); the name comes from the first word in this
                              proverb mmesa (the roaster).</li>
                         <li>Mots'eanong (May) ‚Äì the sorghum grains have become hard ‚Äì too hard for the birds to eat
                              them. It is said that the plants are laughing at the birds, and the name is a contraction
                              of motsheha dinong (the one who laughs at the birds).</li>
                         <li>Phuptjane (June) ‚Äì this is the beginning of Winter, and all plants seem to die and many
                              wild animals leave on migrations. It is said that Nature is holding back on life. The name
                              means "a small holding back" and is a diminutive of the name of the following month.</li>
                         <li>Phupu (July) ‚Äì everything seems completely dead and lifeless. Nature is holding back
                              completely.</li>

                    <h3>Seasons</h3>
                    <p>
                         Like many other sub-Saharan African societies who historically lived in tropical regions,
                         Sesotho-speaking people generally recognise only two seasons (dihla). However, names do exist
                         for all four of the traditional western European seasons. The year begins in approximately
                         August or September, when the crops are planted.

                    <ol>
                         <li>Selemo (spring) ‚Äì from the verb -lema (plant) as the crops are planted at the beginning of
                              this period. This is also the most common name for "year."</li>
                         <li>Lehlabula (summer) ‚Äì more often than not this name is used for both the spring and the
                              summer.</li>
                         <li>Lehwetla (autumn) ‚Äì from the ancient Proto-Bantu root *-ginja ("hot season"). This noun is
                              often used without the class prefix (that is, as Hwetla).</li>
                         <li>Mariha (winter) ‚Äì from the ancient and widespread Proto-Bantu root *-t√Æka ("cold weather;
                              cold season; night"). More often than not this name is used to denote both autumn and
                              winter.</li>

                    <h3>Weekdays</h3>
                    <p>
                         The concept of dividing the month into four seven-day weeks (libeke, from Afrikaans "week") is
                         a recent European innovation. The week begins on Monday.
                    <ol>
